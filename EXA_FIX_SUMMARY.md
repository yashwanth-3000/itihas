# üîç EXA API INTEGRATION - ISSUE IDENTIFIED & SOLUTION

## ‚úÖ **CURRENT STATUS**

### **EXA API**: ‚úÖ WORKING PERFECTLY
- EXA API key is properly configured
- Direct API calls return real, current results
- Custom EXA tool implementation is functional

### **CUSTOM TOOL**: ‚úÖ WORKING PERFECTLY
```python
# This works perfectly when called directly:
result = exa_search_tool._run('latest AI news 2024')
# Returns: Real search results from 2024 with titles, URLs, content
```

### **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: ‚ùå AGENT NOT USING TOOLS
**Problem**: The IBM Granite model is not properly executing tool calls in the CrewAI framework.

**Evidence from logs**:
```
Action: Search the internet
Action Input: {"search_query": "latest OpenAI news"}

Observation
Thought:
I apologize for the error in the previous step. However, since I cannot use the "Search the internet" tool, I will provide a comprehensive research summary based on my existing knowledge cutoff.
```

**Root Cause**: The IBM Granite-3-8B model doesn't properly follow the tool-calling protocol that CrewAI expects.

## üîß **SOLUTIONS TO TRY**

### **Option 1: Force Tool Execution** (RECOMMENDED)
Modify the chat crew to manually invoke the EXA tool before running the agent:

```python
def _chat_with_research(self, user_message: str, conversation_history: List[Dict] = None, analysis: str = None):
    """Enhanced version that forces EXA search"""
    
    # FORCE EXA SEARCH FIRST
    search_results = self.exa_tool._run(user_message)
    
    # Then pass results to agent
    enhanced_message = f"""
    User Query: {user_message}
    
    SEARCH RESULTS FROM EXA:
    {search_results}
    
    Based on these CURRENT search results, provide a comprehensive response.
    """
    
    # Run agent with search results included
    return self._run_crew_with_results(enhanced_message)
```

### **Option 2: Different LLM for Tool Calling**
Use OpenAI GPT for the research agent (better tool-calling) while keeping IBM for response generation.

### **Option 3: Manual Search Integration**
Always perform EXA search first, then inject results into the conversation context.

---

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Step 1**: Implement forced search in `chat_crew.py`
- Modify `_chat_with_research` to always call EXA first
- Inject search results into agent context
- Ensure agent uses search data instead of training data

### **Step 2**: Update response format
- Include search metadata in responses
- Show which sources were used
- Indicate that results are from EXA search

### **Step 3**: Test and verify
- Confirm real-time results are returned
- Verify no more "knowledge cutoff 2021" responses
- Check that current news/events are included

---

## üß™ **EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX**

### **Before** (Current):
```json
{
  "response": "As my knowledge cutoff is 2021, here's what I know about OpenAI...",
  "metadata": {
    "research_used": true,
    "source": "training_data"
  }
}
```

### **After** (Fixed):
```json
{
  "response": "Based on current search results, here are the latest OpenAI developments from 2024...",
  "metadata": {
    "research_used": true,
    "source": "exa_search",
    "search_results_count": 5,
    "search_timestamp": "2024-08-06"
  }
}
```

## üìã **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Implement forced EXA search** in chat_crew.py
2. **Update response metadata** to show EXA usage
3. **Test with current events** to verify real-time results
4. **Update frontend** to display search indicators

**EXA is ready and working - just need to force its usage!** üéØ
