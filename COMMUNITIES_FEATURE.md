## Design Philosophy

### Glass/Monochrome Aesthetics
- **Backdrop Blur**: Consistent use of `backdrop-blur-md` for glass effects
- **Semi-transparent Backgrounds**: White/black overlays with opacity for depth
- **Border Styling**: Subtle borders with `border-white/20` for definition
- **Typography**: Clean, system fonts for readability
- **Color Palette**: Minimal use of color, primarily black, white, and subtle accents

### User Experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed step-by-step
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states, loading animations, and transitions
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design that works on all devices

## Navigation Integration
- Added quick access link from main explore page
- Appears after the intro animation completes
- Consistent with existing navigation patterns

## Future Enhancements
